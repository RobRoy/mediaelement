This is my fork of the fantastic MediaElement.js from [John Dyer](https://github.com/johndyer). It's basically a place for me to play around with HTML5's `<video>` and `<audio>` integration.

## Warning

While I try to keep this rep up-to-date I strongly encourage you to go to the [original project](https://github.com/johndyer/mediaelement) and clone/fork/download the head of the master branch from there.
I don't want to guarantee that what you will find here is always stable and 'production ready' as they say. Also: All the documentation is over there - so go there. Now.
